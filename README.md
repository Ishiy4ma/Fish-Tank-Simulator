# Fish-Tank-Simulator

Fish tank simulator

This program defines a Fish class, which represents a fish with a name and a size, and a FishTank class, which represents a fish tank and contains an ArrayList of Fish objects. The main function creates a FishTank object, adds some Fish objects to it, and then calls a function to print the contents of the tank.

In this example, I have used ArrayList to store the fishes in the tank but you can use other data structures as well.

To display the Fish tank graphically, you can use Java's built-in graphics libraries such as AWT or Swing to create a GUI that displays the fish tank and allows the user to interact with it.

This is a basic example and you can add more complexity and functionality as per your requirements.
